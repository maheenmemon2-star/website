                <h4>Belgian Waffles</h4>
                <p>The Brussels waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It’s also light, thanks to the
                    egg whites that have been beaten into snow and its dough that sometimes rises. Unlike the Liège
                    waffle, it is rectangular and unsweetened, serving as a blank slate on which to add a topping.</p>
                <!--https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors/where-to-eat/bruxelles-et-ses-specialites-culinaires-->
                <p>As I was walking around the main city, all I saw was waffles and fries. Each way I turn there would
                    be another waffles stand serving warm crispy waffles with all types of toppings. I got the oreo and
                    strawberry waffles. The best waffles I had in a while!!!</p>

                <h4>Brussels Frites</h4>
                <p>Crispy, golden fries: they’re our national pride. Did you know that Belgium has more than 4.600 fries
                    stands? That means you can find one in every district and village. Our locals adore them! For the
                    Flemish, fries are anything but a side dish. That’s also the reason we’re so good at making them. As
                    well as having the best potatoes, we also have the pride and the skills to make the best fries in
                    the world. Taking the time to prepare them as they should be, from the correct chopping technique to
                    the second cooking: there’s a real art to the creation of fries.</p>

                <h4>Other food that I ate</h4>
                <p>I also tried sushi, boba, shawarma, and pizza. They were all really good, but not as good as the
                    traditional belgian waffles and fries!
                    There were also a lot of cafes with many sandwiches. I'm pretty sure every cafe had these specific
                    types of sandwiches, but I didn't get to taste them unfortunately :(</p>

                <h2 class="flagtitles2">The Belgian Christmas markets</h2>
                <p>There’s something wonderfully welcoming about Belgian Christmas markets. Perhaps it’s the scent of
                    cinnamon-spiced speculoos mixing with melting chocolate, or the warm glow of fairy lights reflecting
                    off centuries-old cobblestones. Maybe it’s the opportunity to chat with friends over a glass of
                    glühwein around wooden chalets, or the chance to pick up small gifts for family members.

                    If you’re new to Belgium or have never experienced a proper Christmas market, you’re in for a treat.
                    And Belgium does them particularly well, blending medieval charm with modern attractions, local
                    traditions with international flair, and always with lots of food.

                <p>From handcrafted ornaments to local Belgian chocolates, you’ll find something unique for everyone on
                    your list. Just be sure to bring a bag—there’s so much to shop for!</p>

                <h2 class="flagtitles3">Dressing style</h2>
                <p>Belgium has no real dress code for men or women. Usually, you’ll see all sorts of fashion styles,
                    brands, and colors out on the streets. However, typically, the clothing style is conservative and
                    smart. Popular western casual clothing (e.g., jeans, t-shirts, shirts, skirts, dresses, and
                    sneakers) is common. Belgians don’t generally make a big fuss about dressing up to go out and
                    socialize. If you go to a party in jeans and a t-shirt, you won’t look out of place (unless the
                    invite has a specific dress code).</p>
