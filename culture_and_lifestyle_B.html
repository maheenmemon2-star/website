            <h2>Food</h2>
            <h4>Belgian Waffles</h4>
            <p>The Brussels waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It’s also light, thanks to the egg whites that have been beaten into snow and its dough that sometimes rises. Unlike the Liège waffle, it is rectangular and unsweetened, serving as a blank slate on which to add a topping.</p> <!--https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors/where-to-eat/bruxelles-et-ses-specialites-culinaires-->
            <p>As I was walking around the main city, all I saw was waffles and fries. Each way I turn there would be another waffles stand serving warm crispy waffles with all types of toppings. I got the oreo and strawberry waffles. The best waffles I had in a while!!!</p>
            <h4>Brussels Frites</h4>
            <p>Crispy, golden fries: they’re our national pride. Did you know that Belgium has more than 4.600 fries stands? That means you can find one in every district and village. Our locals adore them! For the Flemish, fries are anything but a side dish. That’s also the reason we’re so good at making them. As well as having the best potatoes, we also have the pride and the skills to make the best fries in the world. Taking the time to prepare them as they should be, from the correct chopping technique to the second cooking: there’s a real art to the creation of fries.</p> <!--https://www.visitflanders.com/en/discover-flanders/culinary-treats-and-belgian-beer/fries -->
            <h4>Other food that I ate</h4>
            <p>I also tried sushi, boba, shawarma, and pizza. They were all really good, but not as good as the traditional belgian waffles and fries!
            There were also a lot of cafes with many sandwiches. I'm pretty sure every cafe had these specific types of sandwiches, but I didn't get to taste them unfortunately :(</p>
            <h2>The Belgian Christmas markets</h2>
            <p>There’s something wonderfully welcoming about Belgian Christmas markets. Perhaps it’s the scent of cinnamon-spiced speculoos mixing with melting chocolate, or the warm glow of fairy lights reflecting off centuries-old cobblestones. Maybe it’s the opportunity to chat with friends over a glass of glühwein around wooden chalets, or the chance to pick up small gifts for family members. 

            If you’re new to Belgium or have never experienced a proper Christmas market, you’re in for a treat. And Belgium does them particularly well, blending medieval charm with modern attractions, local traditions with international flair, and always with lots of food.

            <p>From handcrafted ornaments to local Belgian chocolates, you’ll find something unique for everyone on your list. Just be sure to bring a bag—there’s so much to shop for!</p><!--https://harmonizingthechaos.com/brussels-christmas-market-guide/?srsltid=AfmBOoqWlryPxvmzRKon0jkxPOGQiGkVAR_09CQbub0XINTEH5sPDSQa-->

            <h2>Dressing style</h2>
            <p>Belgium has no real dress code for men or women. Usually, you’ll see all sorts of fashion styles, brands, and colors out on the streets. However, typically, the clothing style is conservative and smart. Popular western casual clothing (e.g., jeans, t-shirts, shirts, skirts, dresses, and sneakers) is common. Belgians don’t generally make a big fuss about dressing up to go out and socialize. If you go to a party in jeans and a t-shirt, you won’t look out of place (unless the invite has a specific dress code).</p> <!--https://www.expatica.com/be/living/integration/etiquette-in-belgium-108274/ -->
