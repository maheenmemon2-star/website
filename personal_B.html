                        <p class="side">What I enjoyed most was that there was so much to do; I actually think three
                            days is far too little time to truly experience everything. I loved wandering around the
                            city centre with my siblings, browsing through different shops and discovering little side
                            streets filled with cafés and local stores. Everywhere we went felt safe, warm, and
                            welcoming, which made it easy to relax and just enjoy being there. The atmosphere was lively
                            without ever feeling overwhelming, and every corner seemed to have something new to explore.
                            Overall, it was the kind of place where you could happily spend a week and still feel like
                            there was more waiting to be discovered.</p>

                        <h2>Travelling</h2>
                        <p>It was very easy to travel around because everything was close by like a 5 min
                            walking distance. The taxi people were also really friendly, like the one that took my
                            family
                            from the airport to our hotel. He was trying to have a friendly chat with my brother and
                            joking
                            around with him and all.The hotel was in the centre of brussles city centre so it was a very
                            convenient place to stay.the hotel staff were very nice and friendly and the customer
                            service
                            was top tier! The hotel i stayed in was called novotel brussels. it had a gaming area for
                            kids,
                            a sauna, a swimming pool, and very luxurious and spacoius rooms.</p>

                        <h2>Communication</h2>
                        <p>Communicating was quite difficult because not many people spoke English, which I honestly
                            didn’t expect. Luckily, I knew a bit of French, so that became my main way of speaking with
                            people in restaurants and shops. Even though I sometimes struggled to find the right words,
                            most people were patient and understanding, and it actually felt rewarding to use the French
                            I’ve learned in real situations. It added a small challenge to the trip, but in a way, it
                            also made the experience more memorable.
