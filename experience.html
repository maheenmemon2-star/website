            <article class="experience-highlight">
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>One of the aspects I love most about Romania is the food. It's literally impossible to find bad restaurants anywhere. The people there put so much care and effort into the food and that's what makes it worthwhile.</p>

                <h3>Family</h3>

                <h3>The weather</h3>
                <p>Romanian weather during peak summer season is not to be taken lightly. It was almost impossible to stand outside between 10am to 6pm because of the scorching heat.</p>
