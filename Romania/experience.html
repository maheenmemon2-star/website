        <section id="introduction-experience">
            <p>Traveling to Romania every year is always very exciting. Here's an honest account of my journey this summer, including the highlights, challenges, and everything in between.</p>

            <h2>What I Enjoyed Most</h2>
            
            <article class="experience-highlight">
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>One of the aspects I love most about Romania is the food. It's literally impossible to find bad restaurants anywhere. The people there put so much care and effort into the food and that's what makes it worthwhile.</p>

            <article class="experience-highlight">
                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>I also visited my grandparents and my cousins. I'm always very happy to see them because I don't visit them very often.</p>

                <h3>The weather</h3>
                <p>Romanian weather during peak summer season is not to be taken lightly. It was almost impossible to stand outside between 10am to 6pm because of the scorching heat.</p>
