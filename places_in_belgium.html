                    <p class="side">A landmark in the Brussels skyline, a monumental structure halfway between sculpture
                        and
                        architecture
                        and where the cube flirts with the sphere, a remnant of the past with resolutely futuristic
                        looks, a
                        museum and exhibition centre: the Atomium is not only an object, but also a place, a space, a
                        utopia
                        and a unique emblem in the world which - ultimately - escapes all form of classification.The
                        building was designed and built for the Brussels World's Fair (1958), for which it was the
                        flagship
                        building and emblem.Beyond its symbolic value linked to its history, the Atomium is also one of
                        the
                        icons of Brussels - the capital of Europe - with which it maintains privileged relations. Since
                        its
                        magnificent restoration (2004-2006), which many do not hesitate from calling the most Belgian of
                        monuments, it has rediscovered its place as an international symbol and icon. In addition to
                        being
                        the most popular attraction in the capital and the most beautiful view of the city of Brussels,
                        it
                        is also a unique place to organise your event or shoots.</p>
