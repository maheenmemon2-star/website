                <h2><b>Culture</b></h2>
                <p>The culture of Belgium involves both the aspects shared by all Belgians regardless of the language
                    they speak and the differences between the main cultural communities: the Dutch-speaking Belgians
                    (mostly Flemish) and the French-speaking Belgians (mostly Walloons and Brusselians). Most Belgians
                    view their culture as an integral part of European culture.Famous elements of Belgian culture
                    include gastronomy (Belgian beers, fries, chocolate, waffles, etc.), the comic strip tradition
                    (Tintin, The Smurfs, Spirou & Fantasio, Marsupilami, Lucky Luke, etc.), painting and architecture
                    (Mosan art, Early Netherlandish painting, the Flemish Renaissance, Baroque painting and Art Nouveau,
                    as well as major examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture), folklore,
                    and surrealism.</p> <!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Belgium -->

                <h2>Personal story</h2>
                <p>I went to Belgium in November 2023 during my transition year of secondary school. It was the first
                    other European country I went to other than England, and I have to say it was one of the most
                    memorable experiences of my life. I went to Brussels for 3 days with my whole family of 8 people. We
                    had booked a hotel in the city centre so that everything would be accessible and we could go out
                    without the need of a transport. After arriving at the Brussels airport it was the middle of the
                    night and we had to find a way to get to our hotel. Luckily there were buses so we asked a lady what
                    bus to take. She was very nice and agreed to help us, even took the same bus as us to guide us the
                    whole way. She then told us to take a train after getting off the bus. We didn't know how to use the
                    train station, and the whole station was empty, so we couldn't ask anyone. The women had left too.
                    So my Dad decided to get a taxi. There was a guy walking on the streets, and we asked him how to get
                    a taxi at this hour, since we had a big family we had to get two taxis. The guy was incredibly nice,
                    he stayed until we had left in the taxis to go to our hotel. This was just the first encounter of
                    the people in Brussels, incredibly caring and helpful.</p>
